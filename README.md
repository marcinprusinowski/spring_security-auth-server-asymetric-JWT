# OAuth2 asymmetric Token

## What is asymmetric token ?
Let's start with key value pair. The key in our case is the public key and value of it is private key. Public key is used to verify the token which was signed and generated by authorization server using private key. Every owner of the public key can only **verify** if token is correct.
When we use a Symetric version we always have to provide the signature key to our resource server. The asymmetric token implementation provides two way of implementing it.

## Implementation
1.We generate the key value pair which contains the public key and the private key. The Authorization Server generate the token and sign it by the private key digitally and every owner of public key can only **verify** if the token is correct.
2.Authorization server generate the token and sign it digitally by the private key.
Expose the special endpoint to verify the token from any resource knowing the endpoint. In this approach we have more flexibility  in our system. Imagine if we want to change the key pair and we have 1000 of services having the public key to verify the token. I this case we only make one change and everything else stay the same.

## Example
Let's take a look a this quick example.

User want to have access to some resources. He logins and allow to receive the token by the front-end app. The front-end app calls the resource server with token. Resource server intercept the token and call his authorization server to check if the access_token is correct. If everything is ok the front-end app gets the resource. In our example we can see the second type implementation. If we want to verify our token by resource server we need to make sure we have the public key. Then we do not have to make extra call to the auth server.

## Summary

Feel free to download my project and play with it.
If you only want to test it you can use docker for the quick start.

Authorization Server
	
	docker run -d -p 8080:8080 marcindev99/spring-security-asymetric-as:latest

Resource Server
	
	docker run -d -p 9090:9090 marcindev99/spring-security-asymetric-rs:latest
